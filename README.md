# React and Electron Starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Scripts
* `npm run dev` Runs React **and** Electron in different process, with HMR.
* `npm start` Runs React for development, with HMR.
* `npm run build && npm run electron` Runs Electron for production, no HMR.
